[Hero Extant World Generator 2010](http://www.tophatstuff.co.uk/index.html@p=99.html)
====================================================================

This program has a random world generator that exports easy to read data. You
may like to use it to generate maps for your own projects. Worlds are saved as
binary and also rendered as PNG images. You can find saved worlds in the
"local" folder and information on how to read the data in the "docs" folder.
